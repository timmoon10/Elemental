Notes for v1.0:

- Added the notion of multiple "Devices" for matrices.

- Added GPU support throughout the library. Support is still "as
  needed". Please report gaps to Tom Benson31.

- Using distributed objects with GPU memory requires CUDA-aware MPI.

- Added preliminary Aluminum integration (https://github.com/llnl/aluminum).
